# RAMPART
RAMP Aggregator for Rapid Testing

This is a collection of PHP scripts to aid making Doom community projects by taking away the need to manually assemble individual uploads and alterations. Contributors submit their WADs to a server, which will extract the needed data and compile the submissions into a continuously updated downloadable project that can be accessed by anyone at any time.

The system is entirely file-based and does not require a database. It runs on PHP 5.6 and above.

This was originally written for the RAMP project at https://ramp.teamouse.net - no holes have yet been found that allow anyone to obliterate the entire server it's running on, but use at your own risk!
