<p>There are a ton of guides for editing Doom out on Youtube - here are a few resources to get you started!</p>

<p><a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2015/12/19/you-should-make-a-doom-level-part-1/">Eevee's guide (focuses on mapping with Slade3)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2015/12/19/you-should-make-a-doom-level-part-1/">Linguica's guide (older but still good)</a></p>

<h3>You will need</h3>

<ul>
<li>Either a copy of <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/doom_ii_final_doom">DOOM2.WAD</a> or <a href="https://freedoom.github.io/download.html">FREEDOOM2.WAD from Freedoom</a></li>
<li>A source port for running Doom levels (e.g. <a href="http://prboom.sourceforge.net/">PrBoom</a>, <a href="https://zdoom.org/index">GZDoom</a>)</li>
<li>A DOOM level editor (e.g. <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=232&t=66745">Ultimate Doom Builder</a>, <a href="https://slade.mancubus.net/">Slade3</a>)</li>
<li>(Optional, to get some extra textures to work with) <a href="https://www.wad-archive.com/wad/195ea6c6a1a0b0f70d066bb3125dd1c342858d99">cc4-tex.wad</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I've also collected most of these into <a href="./rampstarterpack.zip">an editing starter pack for Windows, which you can download here</a>. See below for instructions on setting yourself up!</p>

<h3>Setting up</h3>

<p>Here's a video describing how to set yourself up for creating Doom levels with the contents of the starter pack.</p>

<h3>Making a map</h3>

<p>Doom maps can come in several flavours. You might want to stick to the map features possible using the original game, or experiment with the wide array of options added since then in the Universal Doom Map Format (UDMF). This video shows some basics of building a map with both.</p>

<h3>Submitting a WAD</h3>

<p>The easiest way to submit a WAD to RAMP is through the <a href="./upload.php">uploader</a> on this site - you can use the PIN given to you after the initial upload to submit further edits to your WAD once it's been submitted. However, if you have a WAD that doesn't fit through the uploader, you can get in touch with David through the Doomworld thread or on Discord. This video shows how to use the uploader.</p>
