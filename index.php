<img src="./davidn.png" class="inlineimg"/><p>RAMP is the Rabbit's All-comers Mapping Project! It was a mapping event held during June and July 2021 to encourage people to dip into Doom or GZDoom mapping and to give them the chance to be part of a wider project. It was inspired by a previous trilogy of projects <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=52276">DUMP (the Doom Upstart Mapping Project)</a>, and aimed to continue its welcoming spirit.</p>

<p>It attracted two hundred maps of varying flavours - from traditional to modern, vanilla to utter scripted madness, and everything in between. Have fun!</p>
