<img src="./davidn.png" class="inlineimg"/><p>RAMP is the Rabbit's All-comers Mapping Project! This is a mapping event started to encourage people to dip into Doom or GZDoom mapping and to give them the chance to be part of a wider project. It was inspired by a previous trilogy of projects <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=52276">DUMP (the Doom Upstart Mapping Project)</a>, and aims to continue its welcoming spirit.</p>

<p>As implied by the title, everyone is encouraged to submit a map regardless of skill level! The resources on this site will be aimed at people who have very little experience making levels for Doom, but if you're already a veteran, perhaps you could try doing something out of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>After a playtesting period starting in July, I'll release a compilation WAD containing all the levels wrapped up in a wider meta-game, and I'll be glad to provide any feedback you might want!</p>

<p>RAMP is hosted by <a href="http://twitter.com/DavidXNewton">DavidN or DavidXNewton</a>. Online, he is usually found in the form of a Scottish dwarf lop rabbit. Some people say he has a very small pet Doomguy.</p>
